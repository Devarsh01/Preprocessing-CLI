# Preprocessing-CLI

# Overview
Data preprocessing is an integral step in Machine Learning as the quality of data and the useful information that can be derived from it directly affects the ability of your model to learn; therefore, it is extremely crucial that you preprocess your data before feeding it into your model.

One more advantage of preprocessing is that it is considered time consuming for many machine learning developers. This simple CLI tool will save your time so that you can utilize it in applying different machine learning algorithms.


You will apply the following preprocessing steps:

- Handling NULL values
- Encoding Categorical Data
- Feature Scaling
